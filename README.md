# number-array
The purpose of this project is to take a numerical input from the user and insert the numbers into an array.

#regnumarray

With this application the program reads the numerical input, then returns how many inputs that it detected as the number of elments in the array. Finally will print out each element into an array in the order given.


#arrayreverse

For the arrayreverse application it is the same thing as the regnumarray app, except it will return the elements starting from the last input received.
